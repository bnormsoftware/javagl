/**
 * Provides the classes needed to work with OpenGL.  Since LWJGL is the core library being used to work with OpenGL,
 * all the classes are wrappers of the basic functionality.  Usually, the class is an object representation of the
 * objects in OpenGL instead of a group of static calls into OpenGL.  This creates a better object oriented design to
 * work with OpenGL.
